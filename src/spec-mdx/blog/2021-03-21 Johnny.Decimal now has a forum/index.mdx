# Johnny.Decimal now has a forum

> 21st March 2021 | [#meta](/blog/tags/meta/)

We now have a Discourse forum at [forum.johnnydecimal.com](https://forum.johnnydecimal.com). Please join us, there's a lovely crew there already. :-)

There's also a [Discord](https://discord.gg/KYWzAJhmPv) for chat, but everyone (including me) seems to prefer the Discourse as it's a bit gentler on the soul, and the knowledge there is more persistent. So this might go away, we'll see.

That is all, I hope you're all healthy and happy.

# What about 00-09?

You may be wondering why we started our areas at `10-19` and not `00-09`, and our categories at `11` rather than `10`.

## We reserve these for the system

Sometimes you want to keep information _about the system_, in the
system. **I call this ‘Management & Meta’.**

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta">Meta</a> basically means ‘self-referential’.
It’s about itself. Get it? If not, don’t stress.

# 00-09 is about the system itself

I always reserve these numbers for a special area called `00-09 Management & Meta`. Inevitably I want to store some information in my Johnny.Decimal system _about my Johnny.Decimal system_. That goes here.

For example, I have to save <Link to="/concepts/keeping-notes/">text notes</Link> in a folder on my disk. That folder has to live somewhere, and it lives in a category in `00-09`.

One of the text notes I keep at work serves as a quick-reference index to my Johnny.Decimal system. It’s called `00.00 Index`.

## 10, 20, 30 … 90 are about those categories

In the example we’ve been using, `20-29` was `Administration` but our first category was `21 Company registration`. What happened to `20`?

We reserve these numbers for ‘management &amp; meta’ information _about the category_. Although I hardly ever use them, it’s rare that I have more than nine categories in an area. I don’t miss the wasted number, but I always appreciate it when I need it.

# Confused? Don’t worry

If you want to use the zeros, use them. It doesn’t matter.

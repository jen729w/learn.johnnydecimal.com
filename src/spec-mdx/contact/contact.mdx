# Contact me

However you like. My name is Johnny Noble. <span role="img" aria-label="Waving hand">👋🏻</span>

## Email me

The address is **&lt;hello&gt;** at **&lt;this domain&gt;**. Sorry it isn't linked, the spambots will get me otherwise.

	<p>
		As of March 2021 we have{" "}
		<a href="https://forum.johnnydecimal.com">a forum</a>, and posts there will
		be given priority over emails to me directly. I get a lot of similar
		questions and if we can start to build up a database of public answers
		that’ll be better for everyone.

	{/* The next thing isn't a footnote but the class overrides the bottom border. */}
	<p className="footnote-content">
		There’s also <a href="https://discord.gg/KYWzAJhmPv">a Discord</a> for chat,
		but the forum is preferred as the knowledge will be more persistent.

## Call me

Yep. Any time. [+61 415 658 257](tel:+61415658257) (that’s an Australian number).

## Let’s visit!

I’m in Canberra, Australia. If your business is elsewhere, we can work something
out.

It’s _very_ low volume (emails sent since 2019: [1](https://buttondown.email/johnny.decimal/archive)), big update notifications only.

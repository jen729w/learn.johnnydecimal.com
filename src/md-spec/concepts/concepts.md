# Concepts

In this section I will walk you through all of the core concepts in detail.

I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you read the core concepts section end-to-end, in the order shown below, at least once. This will give you a solid grasp of the system; you may then choose to use individual sections like a reference manual.

As you read it, you’ll have questions. Hold your horses and keep reading – I believe I have addressed most of them, but because this is a linear thing it might take me a few pages to get there.

The basic idea of Johnny.Decimal is very simple, but its power comes when you truly understand it. Reading this should give you that understanding; if you still have questions, or if I have not made something clear, please [get in touch](/contact/) and I will help you.

## Core

You should be familiar with this section before you attempt to start your own Johnny.Decimal system.

- [Areas & categories](/concepts/areas-categories/)
- [IDs](/concepts/ids/)
- [Saving files](/concepts/saving-files/)
- [Keeping notes](/concepts/keeping-notes/)
- [Tracking your numbers](/concepts/tracking-your-numbers/)
- [Developing your own system](/concepts/developing-your-own-system/)

## Advanced

You do not need to know everything in this section initially, but you will find it useful as you become more familiar with the system.

- [Managing email](/concepts/managing-email/)
- [What about 00-09](/concepts/what-about-00-09)
- [Working at the terminal](/concepts/working-at-the-terminal)
- [Exceptions to the rules](/concepts/exceptions-to-the-rules)

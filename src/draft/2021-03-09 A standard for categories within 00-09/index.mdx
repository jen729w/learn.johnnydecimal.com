# A standard for categories within 00-09

> 9th March 2021 | [#meta](/blog/tags/meta/)

I've been playing with this idea for a while, I'm not 100% sure it's ready yet so I'll stick it here. Let me know what you think.

We define a set of standard categories that live within `00-09 Management & Meta`.

<Footnote>
	By the way, I have a post half-written which explains the whole '00-09' thing.

You set these up when you create any new system. The purpose of each of the categories is as follows.

- `00 Index`

  - A place for you to store the index of your system.
  - This might be a text note (I use `00.00 Index`), or a folder in your file system which contains a database of some sort.
  - For example, if you use [ResophNotes](http://resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html), it requires a folder in which to store its files. They would go here.

- `01 Inbox`

  - To be used with extreme caution! Inbox = unorganised = anti-the-whole-point-of-this system.
  - But sometimes you really do just need a quick place to throw something. Better that it's here than on your Desktop.
  - I think there's value in having a place, especially at the start of a project, where you can put stuff without having to think about it first. More on this below.

- `02 Notes`

  - Somewhere to keep notes _about the setup of the system_. If they're about a specific thing, they should be in that category. (Again, see the note below about starting up.)

- `03 Todos & checklists`

  - Most systems need somewhere to keep lists of todos and checklists. Put them here.

- `04 Bookmarks`

  - Not just browser bookmarks: I sometimes use this as a place to store links to places that are frequently used in the project. That might be a website, a file system, or anything else.

- `05` to `07` are free for your use.

  - Let me know if you think of anything interesting to put here.

- `08 Someday`

  - David Allen's [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com) is rightly popular and has inspired a few things here. This one's no different -- a place to put stuff you might want to do _someday_.

- `09 Archive`
  - I'm generally against the idea of archiving things. Just leave them where they are and let the fact that new things have higher numbers, which group together, sort it out for you. That said, sometimes there are real reasons to keep something but to stash it out of the way. Who am I to stop you doing that?

## How do I use the Inbox (or Notes)?

## The importance of review

Remember, all of these are optional, they're just an idea to get you started. But I've found having a set whose numbers I can start to remember to be really useful.
